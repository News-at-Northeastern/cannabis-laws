	<p>Though Americans are mostly staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic, outside time in the fresh air has remained important for physical and mental health. Public health experts have advised that outdoor recreation is still a good idea (assuming safe distance from others, of course). But this can be a challenge for residents of dense cities, where living with a yard is a rare privilege.</p>

	<p>The Trust for Public Lands assembled data on density, parkland, and park accessibility for the 100 largest cities by population in the United States. Even larger, more dense U.S. cities aren't necessarily lacking in green space for their residents. Find that info below â€” and find a park to (safely) visit this weekend.</p>
